## Introduction

Hello, my name is Faisal Yudha Nugraha. This repository showcases the process of slicing a Figma design into a responsive modern bank app web page using React and Tailwind CSS. I'd like to give credit to JavaScript Mastery for their YouTube tutorial that served as a valuable resource, and to One Week Wonder for providing the Figma design.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Used for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast development build tool for JavaScript applications, enhancing the development workflow.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for efficient styling.
- **Figma**: The source for the design of this web page.

## Challenge Details

The challenge involved creating a landing page based on the provided design, focusing on the following aspects:

- Replicating the design's layout and visual elements.
